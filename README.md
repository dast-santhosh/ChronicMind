### **About ChronoMind**

ChronoMind is a universal AI memory engine that works as a middleware between the user and any large-language-model API. It allows users to plug in their own API keys—OpenAI, Google DeepMind Gemini, Claude, Azure, Microsoft, Perplexity, OpenRouter, and others—while ChronoMind manages long-term memory locally on the user’s device.

All conversations pass through a two-way memory layer. ChronoMind extracts important user-specific information using NLP pipelines, stores it securely in encrypted local storage, and updates it continuously as conversations evolve. When the user sends a new prompt, ChronoMind retrieves relevant memory, builds an enhanced context package, sends it to the selected AI provider, and then processes the response through the memory layer before displaying it.

The app prioritizes full user control. Memory is stored locally by default (PC internal storage), with optional user-enabled cloud storage via Google Drive or Firestore. No data is uploaded without explicit user choice. This design gives users persistent, personalized AI intelligence across multiple providers without retraining models or depending on centralized servers.

ChronoMind functions as a model-agnostic, privacy-first, context-aware intelligence layer, enabling any AI to maintain continuity, recall preferences, understand long-term patterns, and deliver stable, personalized interactions across sessions.
